## Tone of Voice

### What is Tone-of-Voice?
Our tone-of-voice guides how our communication represents our brand personality and positioning. To claim our enterprise positioning, we refine our brand voice and the tone principles that support it.

- **Voice:** Holistic expression of the brand personality.
- **Tone Principles:** Can be dialed up or down to fit the audience, message, and medium.

**Voice vs. Tone**
- Voice is consistent. Tone shifts by context.

### US vs. UK English
Bynder writes in **US English** for greater global reach and familiarity.

### Active vs. Passive Tense
- Prefer active voice.
  - Passive: *Content creation needs to be scalable and automated.*
  - Active: *Scale and automate your content creation.*

### First Person Usage
Use "we," "ours," and "us"--not "I," "she," "he," or "it." Prefer "Bynder" for whole-company/product references.

### Capitalization
Minimize capital letters except where grammar requires. No all-caps for emphasis. Headings: capitalize only first word.

### Emojis
Use sparingly--max one per post, only if illustrating a point.

### Prepositions
- Customer: "...with Bynder" ("Your content thrives with Bynder.")
- Not "...in Bynder" for product references.

## Visual System

### Brand System Principles

1. **Unite:**
   - Unification of assets into *Datastreams*; order from chaos.
   - Mostly used in motion (e.g., logo animation).

   **Unite Rules:**
   - Always organize datablocks into a single datastream.
   - Datablocks can join existing streams.
   - Offset can be 25%-75% of height for visual layering.

2. **Create:**
   - Shapes datastreams to fit the brand icon.
   - Used in abstractions, graphs, content blocks, UI, infographics.

   **Create Rules:**
   - Strictly align to brand icon using cropping/zoom.

3. **Thrive:**
   - Datastreams symbolize business growth and possibilities.
   - Used for expressive, abstract graphics.

   **Thrive Rules:**
   - Used as pattern, content interaction, masks.
   - Volume level shows extent of thriving (more rows = higher level).
   - **Creating Thrive Visuals in Illustrator:**
     1. Create datastream visual as symbol.
     2. Save as symbol.
     3. Draw a circle (path).
     4. Apply 3D Extrude & Bevel.
     5. Map art, adjust scale, geometry.
     6. Play with size/orientation for final visual.[2]

## Corner Radius

### Datastream Graphics
- Datablocks: Border radius is 24px for 120px height, always 20% of height.
- Ratio doesn't depend on block length.

### Digital Design
- Four categories; sizes increase by 4px:
  - Micro containers (tags): 4px
  - Buttons: 8px
  - Small/Medium containers (datablocks): 12px
  - Large containers: 16px
- Consistent sizing within each category.

### Physical Design
- For printed/physical items, determine corner radius by shortest side of deliverable.
  - Large containers: 1.5% of shortest side.
  - Example: 240cm side -> 3.6cm radius.
- Other containers:
  - Small/medium: 75% large container radius
  - Buttons: 50% large container radius
  - Micro containers: 25% large container radius[3]

## Iconography

### Icon Set
- Use positive icons for accessibility and clarity.
- Minimalistic Google Material Design Icons, with:
  - Weight: 400, Grade: 0, Optical Size: 40, Style: Rounded

### Usage Guidelines
- Place icons within datablocks, not standalone.
- Minimum datablock size: 150% icon bounding box (e.g., 40px icon -> 60px block)
- Optimal size: 200% icon artboard (e.g., 50px icon -> 100px block)
- Center align all icons.
